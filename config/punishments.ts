    name: "Head Shaving",
    definition:
      "Head shaving was employed by the Nazis as a method of public humiliation and dehumanization. Forcibly shaving the heads of individuals, particularly women, served to strip them of their personal identity and dignity. This act was often carried out in public settings to maximize shame and social ostracization. For example, women accused of violating Nazi racial laws or engaging in relationships with non-Germans were paraded through towns with shaved heads as a form of punishment and deterrence.",

  {
    name: "Deprivation of Civil Rights",
    definition:
      "The deprivation of civil rights was a systematic process by which the Nazi regime stripped Jews and other marginalized groups of their legal rights and protections. This process began with the enactment of laws that excluded Jews from civil service positions, such as the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service in April 1933, which led to the dismissal of Jewish professionals from government roles. Subsequent legislation further marginalized Jews by defining who was considered Jewish, prohibiting marriages between Jews and non-Jews, and confiscating property. These legal measures effectively rendered Jews non-citizens within their own country, leaving them vulnerable to further persecution and violence. Both head shaving and the deprivation of civil rights were tools used by the Nazi regime to enforce their ideology, suppress dissent, and isolate targeted groups from the rest of society. These actions contributed to the broader system of oppression that culminated in the atrocities of the Holocaust.",
