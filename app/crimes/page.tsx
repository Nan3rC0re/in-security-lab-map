              This project documents the 344 women prosecuted in Germany for
              Nazi-era crimes. At the time of their trials, the accused women
              ranged in age from 18 to 78 years old. Roughly half were married.
              Of the rest, about 14 percent were unmarried, 7 percent were
              divorced, and 9 percent widowed. More than 15 percent of the
              accused were mothers. Court records indicate that some had as many
              as eight children, though most had one or two. Although some were
              housewives, many of the women worked in a range of fields,
              including as doctors, nurses, and concentration camp guards.

              This map illustrates the towns and cities where these women
              allegedly committed their crimes. Each point provides biographical
              information about the accused, such as their age and marital
              status, as well as some information about their victims.
